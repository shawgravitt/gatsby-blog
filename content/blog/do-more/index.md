Sometime you need to create *bad work* to get to the good work or to find what you are really supposed to be working on.

> Try to do some BAD work — the worst you can think of and see what

> responsible for the world — you are only responsible for your work —
> so DO IT. And don’t think that your work has to conform to any
> preconceived form, idea or flavor. It can be anything you want it to
> be.
